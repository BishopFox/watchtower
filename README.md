What it Does
------------
`Watchtower` is a [Static Code Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis)
tool designed to assist security auditors who are tasked with performing
manual code reviews. It is platform- and language-agnostic.


View a Sample Report
--------------------
Is this Readme TLDR;? Download `/examples/sample_report.html`, and open
it in a web-browser. That's an example report that was generated by `Watchtower`.

Specifically, this is an HTML-formatted report which was run against the
popular (and, IMO, fantastic)
[W3 Total Cache plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/).
Just spend a few minutes playing with the report, and you should quickly
gain a feel for how this program works.

### Notes: ###
1. This is a pretty big HTML file. I'd recommend viewing it in a fast
browser like Google Chrome.
2. I chose this plugin because of its popularity. I'm not implying
at all that I believe it is insecure.


Usage
-----
There are essentially two use-cases for `Watchtower`:

### Importing Scan Data into You Own Application
`Watchtower` can be configured (via command-line options) to output its
analysis data as CSV, XML, or plain text:

	# to output a CSV:
	./watchtower -s /app/path/to/scan -o csv > /path/to/report/file.csv

	# to output XML:
	./watchtower -s /app/path/to/scan -o xml > /path/to/report/file.xml

	# to output plain text:
	./watchtower -s /app/path/to/scan -o txt

The CSV format is useful for importing scan data into a spreadsheet. The
XML format is useful for importing scan data into a custom application. TXT
is less likely to be useful, but it's there if you need it. (You can also
colorize plain-text data with the `--colorize` flag, if you're outputting
directly to the terminal.)

### Outputting a Sortable HTML Report for Direct Review
In my opinion, `Watchtower`'s greatest feature is its ability to output
an HTML report. Such a report can be a tremendous timesaver when scanning
for a large number of payloads in large numbers of files.

This report is especially useful when running dual monitors, such that
you can have the report open on one monitor, and your preferred IDE
open on the other.

To generate the HTML report, run:
	
	./watchtower -s /app/path/to/scan -o html > /path/to/report/file.html -p 'The Project Name'

    
Configuration
-------------
`Watchtower` has an extensive configuration file. (A large number of
configuration options have to do with formatting and content for HTML
reporting.) Please read the comments in the config file itself
(`.config.rb`) for more information.

Also, note that it's possible to specify which config file to use when
executing `Watchtower` via the `--config-file` option. This is useful
when you're working on several projects at once. Rather than having
to repeatedly change config values, you may simply create alternate
config files (`config-project-one.rb`, etc), and then specify which to
use upon execution.


Payload Specification
---------------------
Payloads (by default) live in `<project root>/payloads/`, and are specified
by file type, and then by group, thusly:

	$payloads[:filetype][:group]
	
As in:

	$payloads[:php][:dangerous_functions] = %w[payload payload payload ...]

Payload group divisions will be respected when laying out a generated
HTML report, so creating thoughtful groupings can help to make reports
more navigable.

If you're interested in creating a payload for a new file type, do the following:

	# run this in a terminal:
	ack-grep --help-types

You'll need to use the ack-grep option name (symbolized) as the key
for your new payload. Thus `--java` will translate to `:java`.

Once you've determined the proper key to use for your new filetype, just
create a hash that is structured based off of one of the existing
payloads.


Known Issues
------------
This program has only been tested on Ubuntu 11.04, and may not work on
other platforms. Additionally:

* Watchtower is currently unable to recognize ASP/X files, because `ack-grep`
  (upon which this program relies) itself cannot. I plan to fix
  this in the future.

* If you attempt to generate the same report more than once, you may find
  that the ordering of the elements contained therein will change. (Only
  the ordering of the information will change - the informational content
  itself will not.) This is because my Ruby-Fu is still weak, and I haven't
  yet figured out how to sort some of the nested hashes which the `VulnScanner`
  model assembles before outputting a report. I plan to address this issue
  very soon.


Contributing
------------
I'm very interested in compiling payload sets for popular 3rd-party frameworks.
(For an example, look at `/payloads/wordpress.rb`, which is
Wordpress-specific.) If you have expertise in a popular framework
(Joomla, Drupal, etc), and would like to contribute some payload files,
please let me know. 

Likewise, if you have expertise in a language which is not represented
among the payloads (web or otherwise), I invite you to share your
expertise.
